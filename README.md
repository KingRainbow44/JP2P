# JP2P

A simple peer-to-peer network implementation in Java.

## Usage

See [JP2P.java](src/main/java/moe/seikimo/jp2p/JP2P.java) for an example in the `main` method.

## Notice

This library is very barebones and is not secure.\
If an attacker wanted to, they could find the IP addresses of peers.
